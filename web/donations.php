"Throw in a few QA houses, production databases and data warehousing solutions and the “Drop and Reload” method is not going to work out. Both offering (editor's note: one is deltasql) provide a less painful way to make structure changes in a controlled manner and provide a means to roll these changes back and start again should testing prove unsuccessful. Very powerful!", From the article <a href="http://creative-jar.com/insights/labs/programming/database-source-control-map-those-changes/" target="blank_">Database Source Control: Map Those Changes</a> by Tim Hustler

If deltasql is useful to you and you would like to sponsor further development, consider doing a donation. 
 Larger donations will be used to buy a server to test clients against several database types. We plan also to buy
  a <a href="http://www.iopus.com">web testing framework</a> to automate some unit tests and to increase deltasql reliability. Small amounts are used instead to run Adwords campaigns to advertise deltasql further.
</p>
<p>
You can read <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/deltasql/discussion/">what we plan to do next</a>, which is kind of roadmap, in the forum.

"It works for me :-) Code quality might not be the best, but it allows developers to save time managing database schemas, and it substantially reduces the amount of mistakes due to datamodel-sourcecode asynchronization. There are plenty of clients for the deltasql server. With dbredactor or ant client, it integrates well with Eclipse. 
With the bash client and cron jobs it is even possible to build a continous integration for database schemas.", deltasql contributor via sourceforge in August 2010

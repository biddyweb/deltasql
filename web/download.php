"... Concepts of continouus integration were implemented with Hudson CI and Linux scripts for Build automation and deltasql Version Control System for databases.
</p>
<p>
Consequences were-
(a) time taken for making a software build reduced to an average of 45 to 60 minutes in 2011 as compared to average of 3 to 5 days in 2009.
(b) less number of module integration issues and subsequently less number of bugs reported while testing
(c) quicker turn around time to address new customer requirements"

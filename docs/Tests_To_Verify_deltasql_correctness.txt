MANUAL TESTS TO VERIFY deltasql INTEGRITY

You can run these tests manually, if you install deltasql with the option "Test System (with Test Data)" in http://localhost/install.php.
You then have a set of 14 scripts included in the module "deltasql-test-module" and two branches which are named DELTA_1 and DELTA_2. You should verify that exactly the scripts depicted below
 are present in the synchronization script generated by deltasql, if you use the "Synchronize database schema option". 
The rows below are in the form "from version -> scripts contained in output script".
The project used in these tests is named "deltasql-test-project".

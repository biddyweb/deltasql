1.3.2 Release Notes 11.2.2011
This release reenables the upgrade from production to development schema, which was disabled in 1.3.1
 because the new algorithm in 1.3.0 some basic issues were found.
 
If you upgrade from version 1.3.1 or 1.3.0, you should launch this script on deltasql server schema:
ALTER TABLE tbscriptgeneration ADD  `exclbranch` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default '0';
*******************************

11.2.2011 git
- reimplementing update from production schema (branch) to development schema (HEAD)
- added debug flag on dbsync.php to show debug information in synchronization script
- raised version to 1.3.2
- added one FAQ question on how to move between production and development schemas
- updated manual (Insights on deltasql algorithm chapter)

10.2.2011 git
- removed table when displaying branches in submit_script.php on user request (Hari)
- you need to launch this script when upgrading to version 1.3.2:
ALTER TABLE tbscriptgeneration ADD  `exclbranch` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default '0';

*******************************
1.3.1 Release Notes 26.1.2011
- important set of fixes for the broken synchronization algorithm delivered with 1.3.0
- all buttons renamed from 'Submit Query' into their corresponding action
- if you upgrade from previous versions you should run this script:
INSERT INTO `tbparameter` VALUES ('', 'TEST', 'DB_CONNECTION', 'OK');
- if you installed test data, you should run this script as well:
INSERT INTO tbscript (id, code, module_id, versionnr, user_id, update_dt, update_user, comments, title, isapackage, isaview) VALUES  (9, '-- 6 script only for HEAD before branch DELTA_2 comes', 5, 17, 1, '2008-05-21', '', '', 'db update', 0, 0);
*******************************

26.1.2011 git
- Tests_To_Verify_deltasql_correctness.txt updated
- if test data is used, add this missing script to verify deltasql correctness:
INSERT INTO tbscript (id, code, module_id, versionnr, user_id, update_dt, update_user, comments, title, isapackage, isaview) VALUES  (9, '-- 6 script only for HEAD before branch DELTA_2 comes', 5, 17, 1, '2008-05-21', '', '', 'db update', 0, 0);
- Fix in dbsync algo patching test cases 1-5
- Test cases 6 and 7 now are much more difficult, and need some idea to handle them.
In the meanwhile I added an error message to inform the user that upgrades from development
 schemas to production schemas are not supported yet. The documentation was upgraded to reflect this fact.
- Test case 8 is even more difficult and needs the concept of merging... It is about upgrading a production schema to a newer production schema.
This case can not be even detected at the moment.
- added following parameter to TBPARAMETER:
INSERT INTO `tbparameter` VALUES ('', 'TEST', 'DB_CONNECTION', 'OK');
 used in script check_db_connection.php which could be later used in bash deltasql clients


24.1.2011 git
- changed all buttons from "Submit query" to action text in caption
- bugfix in edit_script.php: Tags are not allowed
- bugfix in search_scripts.php: Tags are not allowed

21.1.2011 git
- added FAQ question on verification step
- minor changes in FAQ document

*******************************
1.3.0 Release Notes 30.12.2010
Completely new synchronization algorithm which handles among others branches of branches,
 tagging and upgrade from production to development schema.
 
WARNING: if upgrading production environments from previous versions, please always
 create a backup copy, and adjust table TBBRANCH manually to include sourcebranch and sourcebranch_id.
 In such cases, you can get support from gpu-world at lists.sourceforge.net

When upgrading deltasql server, please launch the following script:

ALTER TABLE `tbbranch` ADD `sourcebranch` VARCHAR( 40 ) NULL;
ALTER TABLE `tbbranch` ADD `sourcebranch_id` int(11) default NULL;
UPDATE `tbbranch` SET sourcebranch='HEAD' where name<>'HEAD';
UPDATE `tbbranch` SET sourcebranch_id=1 where name<>'HEAD';
ALTER TABLE `tbbranch` ADD `istag` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default '0';
ALTER TABLE tbsynchronize ADD tagname varchar(128) NULL;
CREATE TABLE `tbscriptgeneration` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `sessionid` varchar(40) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `fromversionnr` int(11) default NULL,
  `toversionnr` int(11) default NULL,
  `frombranch` varchar(40) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `tobranch` varchar(40) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `frombranch_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `tobranch_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `create_dt` datetime default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COLLATE=latin1_general_ci AUTO_INCREMENT=1;

You should launch on database schemas under deltasql versioning the following statement: 
ALTER TABLE tbsynchronize ADD tagname varchar(128) NULL;
*******************************

30.12.2010 git
- added tagname to table TBSYNCHRONIZE, on the schemas where deltasql is active,
one should run a statement:
ALTER TABLE tbsynchronize ADD tagname varchar(128) NULL;

This column records the name of the tag, in case the synchronization was up to a tag.

- adjusted test data during install procedure. Install procedure tested
- documenting new synchronization step in manual and FAQ.
  

24.12.2010 git
implemented tagging :-), including all business logic around it :-)

23.12.2010 git
- logic to upgrade schemas from production to development (HEAD) added as well
----------------
- error messages 7 and 4 removed, as they are superseeded by error 13
----------------
I think the new synchronization algorithm works already :-)                     
The next steps are:                                                             
- add logic when upgrading from production schema to development schema         
- add logic to support tags (quite simple)   
----------------
- added sourcebranch_id to table tbbranch, and making sure datamodel is consistent when
 branching
- get_and_increase_globalversion() when branching, instead of get_globalversion()
- modified structure of table tbscriptgeneration to improve its performance: instead of
 storing each script individually, we only store each segment of the path in the tree. 
- started modifying dbsync_update.inc.php to fullfill the new algorithm

- TODO: the whole test data must be regenerated, also the compatibility with the old
 branching mechanism is lost!!!

22.12.2010 git
This are changes resulting from the proposals of Harikrishnan Nair, Peter Kevin
 and Ramesh Raghavan. In particular, the document sent by Ramesh was very enlightning. 

Synchronization will be implemented as tree traversal beginning from the leaf
 in direction of the root until sourcebranch and scriptversion match. When traversing
  back, each encountered script will be added to a table tbscriptgeneration. When
 the traversing across the branches is done, the table tbscriptgeneration 
  is ORDERED BY script_id ASC and passed to a outputscript() routine as 
    it is already implemented now. To allow multiple synchronizations steps
	 to be processed at once, a session id is generated.
	 
Traversing back from leaf to root makes the traversal unique and easy. The only
 thing to be implemented as exception to the algorithm is when changing from
 production schema to development schema. In this case, all scripts which
 belong to HEAD but not to the traversal will be added to the output of the script.

Tagging will be implemented in this way: tags are stored in tbbranch with istag=1
 and being the sourcebranch the tagged branch and versionnr the moment where the
 tag was issued. When taking a branch to begin the traversal, the highest script number
 of HEAD is taken as starting point, when taking a tag the stored versionnr is taken instead. 
 
 
Changes: 
- fix in head.inc.php as some browsers did not support the rough way it 
was implemented
- added istag column to table TBBRANCH to support tagging
- added sourcebranch column to table TBBRANCH and logic to populate it
- added table TBSCRIPTGENERATION which will be used in the new synchronization
 step which will be more straightforward then the current one.
 
IMPORTANT: users who upgrade from previous
 versions should execute these statements in their deltasql schema:
 
 ALTER TABLE `tbbranch` ADD `sourcebranch` VARCHAR( 40 ) NULL;
 ALTER TABLE `tbbranch` ADD `sourcebranch_id` int(11) default NULL;
 UPDATE `tbbranch` SET sourcebranch='HEAD' where name<>'HEAD';
 UPDATE `tbbranch` SET sourcebranch_id=1 where name<>'HEAD';
 ALTER TABLE `tbbranch` ADD `istag` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default '0';
 CREATE TABLE `tbscriptgeneration` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `sessionid` varchar(40) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `fromversionnr` int(11) default NULL,
  `toversionnr` int(11) default NULL,
  `frombranch` varchar(40) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `tobranch` varchar(40) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `frombranch_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `tobranch_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `create_dt` datetime default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COLLATE=latin1_general_ci AUTO_INCREMENT=1;

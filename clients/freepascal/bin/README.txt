Some notes on the deltaclient (22.5.2014 v1.7.0)
To get install instructions point your browser at http://deltasql.sourceforge.net/deltasql/manual.php#install-deltaclient-windows

Restart once
------------

If you want to test with the deltasql.sourceforge.net/deltasql instance, you need to restart at least once the deltaclient.

Hangup at startup
-----------------
If you are running behind a proxy and did not get the proxy parameter right at the first startup, deltasql hangs when running it the second time.
To fix the problem, you should run reset.bat, execute deltaclient.exe, hit the Settings button and set the correct proxy parameters.
Then, everything will work as expected.
